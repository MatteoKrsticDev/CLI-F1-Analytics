# CLI-F1-Analytics

Very simple cli tool made in python to visualize the graph of the fastest lap of an f1 driver. <br>
The `cache` folder is used to make the program faster by downloading the resources directly in your computer. <br>
To run this you have to open a terminal and type: `pip install matplotlib`, `pip install colorama`, `pip install fastf1` <br>
 
### Disclaimer
I reccomend to run this on a windows powershell if you want the cli colors.
